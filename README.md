A stable version of Tomcat 8 and JRE 8 for Raspberry Pi similar to other images on docker hub except this one does not remove apt sources; hence, it is extensible. The [latest](https://github.com/gordonforce/rpi-tomcat/blob/master/Dockerfile) tag grabs Tomcat version 8.5.11. Seen as a base image for Tomcat dependent applications.
